# Lord of the Rings SDK Design
The Lord of the Rings SDK is designed to provide a convenient and intuitive interface for developers to interact with the Lord of the Rings API. The SDK follows a modular and extensible structure, allowing easy integration and future-proofing.

## Architecture
The SDK consists of the following main components:
LotrClient: This class acts as the entry point for interacting with the Lord of the Rings API. It provides methods for retrieving movie and quote data from the API.
LotrMovie: This class represents a Lord of the Rings movie and provides convenient methods for accessing movie information such as ID, title, and associated quotes.
LotrQuote: This class represents a quote from the Lord of the Rings universe and provides methods for retrieving the ID and content of the quote.

The SDK follows the principles of encapsulation and abstraction to hide the underlying HTTP requests and provide a simplified and intuitive interface.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on the following external libraries:
requests: Used for making HTTP requests to the Lord of the Rings API.

## Error Handling
The SDK handles errors by raising exceptions when necessary. It utilizes the requests library's built-in exception handling mechanism to handle HTTP errors. If a request to the API fails or returns an error status code, an appropriate exception is raised, providing meaningful error messages to the developer.

## Caching
The SDK does not implement caching directly. However, it can leverage external caching mechanisms at the HTTP layer or utilize caching libraries to improve performance and reduce redundant API requests. By implementing caching strategies, developers can enhance the SDK's performance and reduce network overhead.

## Versioning
The SDK does not currently support versioning of the Lord of the Rings API. However, it can be extended in the future to accommodate version-specific features or changes in the API.

## Potential Improvements

Pagination support: The SDK can be enhanced to handle paginated responses from the API, allowing developers to retrieve large sets of data more efficiently.
Additional endpoints: While the current SDK covers the movie and quote endpoints, future versions could expand the coverage to include other endpoints provided by the Lord of the Rings API, such as character or location information.
Authentication: If the Lord of the Rings API introduces authentication requirements, the SDK can be extended to support authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure access to protected resources.
Asynchronous support: The SDK can be optimized to support asynchronous requests using asyncio or other asynchronous programming techniques, enabling developers to make concurrent API calls and improve performance.
Documentation: The SDK documentation can be further expanded to provide comprehensive examples, usage scenarios, and integration guides, facilitating ease of use and adoption.
